# Tickets App

This application simulates the working of a public office in which people is attended following an order by the use of numbered tickets.

The front-end is developed with React using the components UI library Ant Design.

The backend is an Express server that uses web sockets (using Socket.io) for real time communicacion with different clients.

This application is based on Fernando Herrera's ticket app for his React + WebSockets course on Udemy. I've developed some functions on my own instead of following Fernando's steps because of my ideas about how to improve app code and architecture. Some example of my own developments are the navigation, user and hooks contexts on client app, using a reducers approach I've considered more scalable and better. The queue management in the back end is different too.
